### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p>Hello, welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Nicolas Jandre, and I am a 24-year-old front-end developer from TeresÃ³polis.

Here you will find a sample of my most recent projects, where I have used different technologies to develop modern and functional web applications. Some of the technologies I am proficient in are: ReactJS, NextJS, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, among others.

Among the projects I have shared, you will find applications ranging from authentication and content management systems to note-taking and online payment tools. I always strive to stay up-to-date with market trends and use best development practices to create efficient and high-quality solutions.

Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you would like to discuss job opportunities or collaborate on interesting projects.

Thank you for visiting!</p>
